<h1>1. Personal Information</h1>

    <ol>
    <li>My name is Jae Jun Kim, student number is S3741333 and the email address is s3741333@rmit.edu.vn. First of all, I am from Republic of Korea thus, I speak Korean and English as well. Normally, most Korean are polite when they meet people because they do not like to have a bad effect on other people and it is a kind of Korean culture. My hobbies are listening to music and handle a computer. Especially, I like American music which inherent magnificent bass sound as well as Korean music. Furthermore, I interested to handle a computer from a young age. Therefore, when I check some problems or errors in the computer, I must solve the problems then I feel lighter. I am not good to handle a computer yet, but I am trying to be competent. </li></ol>
<h1>2. Interest in I.T </h1>
    <ol>
    <li>1.	At first, I wanted to be a web developer. These days, not only companies but also individuals open websites because computers have become more popular. Among them, I want to make a website that people can use. As I began to get interested in the web, I began to be interested in other areas of the computer, among which the database was quite attractive. A database is a necessary task to collect various important data and then make efficient use of them.
2.	When I lost interest in college because I couldn't go to the university which I applied to when I was young. After reading an article about the importance of globalization in the news article, I was looking for overseas universities rather than limited universities in Korea, and I found out that there is RMIT university in Vietnam where my father works, and I was interested in learning English and decided to go to RMIT in Vietnam because I wanted to enjoy studying globally.
3.	My current goal is to learn various computer languages and make some of them mine by doing my best in the department I am studying.

    <p>2.	Database developer is a job that collects various data in one field and organizes necessary data and makes efficient use of it. Since I was young, I thought efficiency is important in whatever I do, so I found this job attractive to me and it was interesting to collect various information.
3.	Every job has the necessary abilities. Database developer first needs more than two years of language experience, such as SQL and Oracle. In addition, they must have experience in developing ETL and must excel at SAP. Finally, good communication skills with team members are required.
4.	Actually, I do not have any qualifications and experiences yet because I am on the starting step now and learning a few computer languages. However, as I mentioned at above, I am trying to hard at my subjects and will get computer skills. Firstly, I will finish Python, Java programming, SQL and Oracle then get the qualifications what compatible to me.

    <br>
    <p2>First of all, to analyze the personality test chart, which is the first result, the biggest part is thinking and solving the problem. I solve problems by thinking about what is more efficient and what is more appropriate. The result of the second learning style test has many things to learn from touch and sight. I have the most learning effects when I experience and feel it myself. The final result of the job test was a high score in the innovation part. I am suitable for a job that requires innovative ways to improve the system and solve problems through analysis technology. These results mean that I like to think a lot, analyze, and to solve difficult problems. Besides, I like to discuss it with people. First, we investigate and analyze individually and then discuss with people how to solve these problems. These tendencies of mine cause a more passionate atmosphere for the company and result in efficient results and have a good effect on teamwork.</p2></ol>
    <h1>5. Project Ideas</h1>
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li>As many people visit libraries located in RMIT, modern people visit libraries to accumulate knowledge or borrow books. That's why libraries have to buy many new books and register each book on the library computer for those who borrow books. The result of registering the book on the computer can be borrowed and returned much faster. For example, when a person borrows a book, he or she just takes a bar code of the book at the information desk, and the book is entered into the computer for a set period of time. However, how do they enter data about books into your computer?
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>I am a student who often uses the library where I do homework and borrow books. One day, I happened to learn how to use the library over the Internet in an Introductory to Information Technology class. And I suddenly thought, 'How can libraries manage many library users and books?' A few days later, I was thinking about what to do after I got my first assignment in my department, and I thought about what I often think, what I learned, and what I want to do at future, and then I decided that library collect book's data through Python and write about the library management system.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Listing the characteristics of the library computer program, it is possible to quickly and accurately manage the information of users and books by introducing the computer program in the library. For example, assuming that a library user is looking for a book called 'A', the library administrator can derive the results of where 'A' is based on the book information registered in the library systems, and the user can find 'A' more conveniently and easily. Also, if a person named 'Jackson' borrowed a book ‘B’ but did not return it after the loan period, the administrator can contact 'Jackson' with the who borrowed ‘B’ information stored on the computer. Next, to analyze what the library program does, the program can store information about new books such as titles, writers, and publishing dates through various computer programs. Second, books are often damaged by many users, library administrators who have to manage and organize them. Damaged books, old books can easily identify books to release by examining a list of many used books derived from the publication date, purchase date, and a number of times borrowed in the system. In addition, it is essential that libraries prepare for popular writers' books and now popular books. Computer programming not only stores information, but also uses programs to analyze data to collect information about books that are currently popular in the book market, and books written by popular writers, and to make a list to be purchased in the library. In addition, the library's computer program stores information about users as well as books information. For example, if library administrators want to host a small or big event for some library users, administrators can check which person borrowed the most a lot of amount of books through the library program and if the library is a place that needs an access card, administrators can check which person visited the most. And we can award a product or something through such things as the result. Or, you can collect information from several newly registered users at once and give prizes to some people through a randomly. Finally, it is also important for libraries to prevent books from being stolen. In preparation for the theft of books in the library, all books are barcoded in the program and certain some specific sensors are installed, then the library computer program can prevent books from being cut off. For example, if you install a bar-shaped sensor with an automatic detection sensor at the exit and entrance of the library, people must enter or exit the library only by the path where the sensor is installed, and if the person who wants to steal the book carries a book without entering the loan code on the computer and goes out through the exit or entrance, the sensor can sound an alarm to prevent theft.
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>The project will go on with Python thus the Python programming program such as Pycharm and its usable license will be required. Moreover, as a student in learning process on and off line sources that helps to study and understand basic concept of coding and Python are needed. The useful open sources for coding will be available online. Furthermore, If having experiences that using tools from other jobs, that will be certified a technologies. Because the point of view of employers, handling Pycharm program to be fast and efficient is important and the experiences of other jobs certifies using program competently</li>
    <br>
    <li>In conclusion, if my proposed library project is realized, less improved libraries can lead to convenience and accuracy not only for managers but also for library users by applying a better system. You can register books and members' information through the Pycharm program and build a more systematic library system with that information. In addition to the information system, if the library installs a bar-type theft alert system in case of theft, bar codes in the library's books entered in Pycharm will respond by passing through the bar and the response will prevent theft.</li><ol>
