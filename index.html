    <h2>1. Personal Information</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>My name is Jae Jun Kim, student number is S3741333 and the email address is s3741333@rmit.edu.vn. First of all, I am from Republic of Korea thus, I speak Korean and English as well. Normally, most Korean are polite when they meet people because they do not like to have a bad effect on other people and it is a kind of Korean culture. My hobbies are listening to music and handle a computer. Especially, I like American music which inherent magnificent bass sound as well as Korean music. Furthermore, I interested to handle a computer from a young age. Therefore, when I check some problems or errors in the computer, I must solve the problems then I feel lighter.

    <h3>2. Interest in I.T </h3>
    <ol>1.	At first, I wanted to be a web developer. These days, not only companies but also individuals open websites because computers have become more popular. Among them, I want to make a website that people can use. As I began to get interested in the web, I began to be interested in other areas of the computer, among which the database was quite attractive. A database is a necessary task to collect various important data and then make efficient use of them.
2.	When I lost interest in college because I couldn't go to the university which I applied to when I was young. After reading an article about the importance of globalization in the news article, I was looking for overseas universities rather than limited universities in Korea, and I found out that there is RMIT university in Vietnam where my father works, and I was interested in learning English and decided to go to RMIT in Vietnam because I wanted to enjoy studying globally.
3.	My current goal is to learn various computer languages and make some of them mine by doing my best in the department I am studying.
